"Price It!" provides price estimates for commonly traded items on ebay. It works by scraping ebay for the results of your search term, extracting the data and then analysing it providing you with lower, median and upper price estimates.

This repository contains the frontend code which has been built using Facebook's React library along with Redux to handle application state.
